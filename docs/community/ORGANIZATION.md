# Organization

This document describes how the organization works on the people side. So, if
you want to know who is responsible and how we organize our decisions, this
document may be right for you.

## Chart

The below chart shows the general hierarchy or
[while-true-do.io](https://while-true-do.io).

![organization image](../assets/organization.drawio.svg)

## Groups

At [while-true-do.io](https://while-true-do.io) we try to keep the complexity
low. There are only 2 types of groups established. One is meant for the overall
steering and the other type is intended to allow more flexibility for
developers.

### Board

The board is the decision backbone of
[while-true-do.io](https://while-true-do.io) and is guiding the community
regarding the vision, mission and larger objectives. It is made up of an odd
number of members (minimum 3, maximum 9). The board will be voted every year
from all contributors.

As a board member, you need to participate in all board meetings.
Furthermore, board members must ensure that the community can work together and
support them with resources and knowledge.

### Special Interest Groups

Most development effort should be handled by an expert group. These experts can
form a Special Interest Group (SIG) and therefore become the official
maintainers of certain features or objective. To become a Special Interest
Group, the following criteria must be met:

- at least 3 committers, maintainers or owners reside in the SIG
- there must be regular public meeting (eg.: once a month) to discuss
  progress and issues and gather feedback
- the group must maintain a Product Requirements Document describing the purpose
  and value of the group
- the group must publish a regular review of achieved features and goals

If all of the above is done, a group can apply to the board and become an
official SIG. This will allow the group to:

- take over and organize repositories and features meeting the PRD
- create and maintain own repositories
- define a roadmap for features and value of the group
- define how they do their work

No organizational patterns are proposed for these groups. You can organize
yourself however you want, as long as you work towards the general goals as
defined in the [Introduction](../README.md).

In case the group needs resources like compute power, storage, chat channels or
mail groups, these can be self-organized or requested via the board meetings.

## Members

The backbone of every community are the members. We really appreciate everybody
who wants to join the hard work, provide knowledge or help us in other ways.

Becoming a member and contributing should be as easy as possible. On the other
hand, we need at least a little bit of structure and found the below roles
useful.

### Maintainers

A maintainer is a very trustworthy member that is participating actively in
designing and moving [while-true-do.io](https://while-true-do.io) forward. The
board will be represented by a maximum of 9 maintainers, that are either elected
by all committers or represented by an owner.

A maintainer is able to design the direction and future of
[while-true-do.io](https://while-true-do.io) directly through design decisions,
creating objectives and guidance in general. A maintainer is also able to merge
code into our baseline, if this is not handled from a SIG or an approved
committer.

A maintainer is responsible for a healthy community, quality of code and for
[while-true-do.io](https://while-true-do.io) in general. Therefore, he must
participate in the board meetings and represent the community in a transparent
way.

To become a maintainer you need to be elected in the yearly maintainer voting.
If you want to be elected, it is enough to become a committer and
apply/candidate for the position.

### Owners

Owners are default maintainers by two facts:

- they created the project/community [while-true-do.io](https://while-true-do.io)
- the board has voted unanimously for somebody to become an owner

Owners do have the same privileges and responsibilities as other maintainers,
but in addition they will handle secrets for central infrastructure and
accounts.

There can be a maximum of 3 owners at the same time. Since owners are voted for
lifetime, we do have mechanisms to release owners.

- the board votes unanimously against an owner
- the owner puts down the ownership on his own

### Committers

A committer is every contributor, who is actively participating in the
development on a regular basis.

A committer is invited to join all representing groups and can directly interact
with the code (ex. become member of the github organization), but can also
perform reviews.

A committer must actively participate in the development of
[while-true-do.io](https://while-true-do.io) on a regular basis. If a committer
becomes inactive for 12 months, he will loose the status and become a
contributor.

Every contributor can become a committer either automatically or via application
and approval from the board. Applying to become a commiter is often bound to
a menthorship program for 6-12 months from at least another committer or
maintainer.

### Contributors

A contributor is everybody who wants to contribute to the project. You don't
need to write code but provide some kind of value. This can be a blog article,
documentation, feature requests and bug reports, testing or quality assurance
and much more.

In fact, everybody who is providing at least something to the community can
become a contributor and will be mentioned (if wanted) in the contributors
list. This list is generated and curated once every 6 months. In case we missed
your contribution, please feel free to point us to the contribution you made
and the way you want to be displayed.
