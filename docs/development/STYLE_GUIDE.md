## Logo

The logo is a stylized turtle. The turtle stands for sustainability,
reliability, steadiness and wisdom. The form is defined by the infinity symbol
and is reflecting the "while true do = infinite loop" idea.

## Typeface

For browser applications (like websites), one should rely on system fonts.
The user is already familiar with his system and should not be forced to use
another font.

On the other hand, on documents like \*.pdfs, written letters or when creating
images, one should rely on the below typefaces.

We have chosen a font, which is good looking, well known and easy to read. It
is also under a free license and widely used in Open Source environments.

- Name: DejaVu Fonts
- Link: <https://dejavu-fonts.github.io>
- License: <https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/License.html>
- Download: <https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/Download.html>
- Variants: Sans, Serif, Mono

### Typeface Sans

Sans fonts are often used on digital presentations like:

- websites
- mobile applications
- desktop applications

<!-- TODO: provide example -->

### Typeface Serif

Serif fonts are often used for documents on an analog medium like:

- letters
- paper documents
- brochures

<!-- TODO: provide example -->

### Typeface Mono

Mono fonts are quite technical and should only be used in a technical context
like:

- code blocks
- terminals

<!-- TODO: provide example -->
