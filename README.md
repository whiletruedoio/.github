# .github

Template files and descriptions for the while-true-do.io organization.

## Motivation

Some documents and files need to be maintained accross multiple repositories.
This often leads to inconsistencies and fragmented information. Having a default
place to create and update such files and documents is desired.

## Description

The repository uses a
[functionality of GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions),
where you can provide certain documents and use them as default documents for
all repositories in an organization.

### Issue Templates

Issue templates are a feature from GitHub, so users and contributors can open
new issues in an easy and convenient way. This will also providing options for
maintainers to ask for information and suggest a proper format for issues.

You can find the default issues in the [.github](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)
directory. Repository owners are free to add more templates to the repositories,
if needed.

### Community Documents

In addition to templates a community like
[while-true-do.io](https://while-true-do.io) has common guidelines and documents.
These are maintained here, too. You can find the documents in the [docs](./docs)
directory. Other repository can/should link to the documents by default.

### Organisation profile

The .github repository is also used to provide an entry point for the
organisation. The file [profile/README.md](./profile/README.md) is published in
the project overview and visible for every visitor and contributor. It should
contain common information, so new members, contributors, committers and users
can find some entrypoints.

## Contribute

Thank you so much for considering to contribute! We are happy, when someone is
joining the hard work.
